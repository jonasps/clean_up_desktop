# Clean up desktop (for OS X)

clean_up_desktop.py is a small efficiency scrip to help you organize your files. 

  - It organizes all your "stuff" into folders
  - It let's you decide what files or folders to leave on the desktop
  - It turns you into a more efficient and happier person

By adding the names of files and folders you DON'T want to move inside the list `self.do_not_move`  they will stay on your desktop.
    Example
    `self.do_not_move = ["Download", "old_folders", "pictures"]`
